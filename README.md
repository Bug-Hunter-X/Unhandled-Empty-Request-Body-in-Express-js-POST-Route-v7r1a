This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of error handling for empty or invalid request bodies in POST requests. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.  The server should always validate incoming data to prevent unexpected crashes and ensure robust functionality.
